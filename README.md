#Build with Wordpress

I built my portfolio on WordPress using plugins like Elementor, Essential Addons for Elementor, and WP Forms Lite. Elementor helped me design visually appealing layouts for my portfolio pages . Essential Addons provided additional widgets and features to enhance my website's functionality, such as dynamic content elements. With WP Forms Lite, I created user-friendly contact forms, making it easy for potential clients to reach out to me
